<script src="/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js"></script><p>The Real Data Lab aims to fill the gap between taking a programmingor statistics class and actually designing and running a statisticalanalysis on your data. MIT offers myriad quantitative classes, butcurrently there is no roadmap for students to apply the abstractconcepts learned in these classes to their own research.</p><p>We will provide online documentation, workshops, and one-on-onemeetings to help with the practical application of statistics andprogramming to research.</p><p>The Real Data Lab focuses on three core competencies:</p><p><strong>Reproducibility</strong> — Without structure, it is easy foranalyses to devolve into a folder of undocumented scripts that no oneelse could use. We will teach you how to build portable pipelines thatother labs can use to go from your raw data to the figures and tablesyou publish so that your work is truly reproducible.<br /><em>Skills: Snakemake, conda, Docker, git, GitHub</em></p><p><strong>Modern Statistics</strong> — Statistics is more like anengineering discipline than pure math. Real data is messy in ways uniqueto each project and models need to be custom built to handle thatmessiness. We will teach you a general framework of statistical modelingthat goes beyond picking the “right” test for your data so that you candesign robust analyses.<br /><em>Skills: Bayesian statistics, MCMC sampling, model comparison,statistical learning</em></p><p><strong>Effective Computation</strong> — Most analyses can scale upto run on many computers at once, drastically reducing the time spentwaiting for results and iterating on your analysis. We will teach youwhat computational resources are available at MIT and work with you todetermine what would work best for your data.<br /><em>Skills: Linux clusters, data storage/backup, cloud basedinfrastructure</em></p>
