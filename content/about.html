<p>The Real Data Lab aims to fill the gap between taking a programming
or statistics class and actually designing and running a statistical
analysis on your data. MIT offers myriad quantitative classes, but
currently there is no roadmap for students to apply the abstract
concepts learned in these classes to their own research.</p>
<p>We will provide online documentation, workshops, and one-on-one
meetings to help with the practical application of statistics and
programming to research.</p>
<p>The Real Data Lab focuses on three core competencies:</p>
<p><strong>Reproducibility</strong> — Without structure, it is easy for
analyses to devolve into a folder of undocumented scripts that no one
else could use. We will teach you how to build portable pipelines that
other labs can use to go from your raw data to the figures and tables
you publish so that your work is truly reproducible.<br />
<em>Skills: Snakemake, conda, Docker, git, GitHub</em></p>
<p><strong>Modern Statistics</strong> — Statistics is more like an
engineering discipline than pure math. Real data is messy in ways unique
to each project and models need to be custom built to handle that
messiness. We will teach you a general framework of statistical modeling
that goes beyond picking the “right” test for your data so that you can
design robust analyses.<br />
<em>Skills: Bayesian statistics, MCMC sampling, model comparison,
statistical learning</em></p>
<p><strong>Effective Computation</strong> — Most analyses can scale up
to run on many computers at once, drastically reducing the time spent
waiting for results and iterating on your analysis. We will teach you
what computational resources are available at MIT and work with you to
determine what would work best for your data.<br />
<em>Skills: Linux clusters, data storage/backup, cloud based
infrastructure</em></p>
