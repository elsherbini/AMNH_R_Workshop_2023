<p><strong>argument</strong>: one of possibly several expressions that
are passed to a function. Oftentimes parameter and arugument are used
interchangably, even though techincally parameter refers to the variable
and argument refers to the value.</p>
<p><strong>assignment operator</strong>: Symbol that assigns values on
the right to an object on the left. Looks like <code>&lt;-</code>.
Keyboard shortcut is <code>Alt + -</code></p>
<p><strong>comment</strong>: Text written in a script that is not
treated as code to be run, but rather as text that describes what the
code is doing. These are usually short notes, beginning with a
<code>#</code></p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)</strong>: A public
repository of R packages.</p>
<p><strong>data frame</strong>: A two-dimensional data structure for
storing tabular data in memory. Rows represent records and columns
represent variables.</p>
<p><strong>function</strong>: A code block which gathers a sequence of
operations into a whole, preserving it for ongoing use by defining a set
of tasks that takes zero or more required and optional arguments as
inputs and returns expected outputs (return values), if any. Functions
enable repeating these defined tasks with one command, known as a
function call.</p>
<p><strong>NA</strong>: A special value used to represent data that is
not available.</p>
<p><strong>pipe operator</strong>: The <code>%&gt;%</code> used to make
the output of one function the input of the next.</p>
<p><strong>package</strong>: A collection of code, data, and
documentation that can be distributed and re-used. Also referred to in
some languages as a library or module.</p>
<p><strong>parameter</strong>: A variable specified in a function
definition whose value is passed to the function when the function is
called. Parameters and arguments are distinct, but related concepts.
Parameters are variables and arguments are the values assigned to those
variables. In practice though these terms are often used
interchangeably.</p>
<p><strong>positional argument</strong>: An argument to a function that
gets its value according to its place in the function’s definition, as
opposed to a named argument that is explicitly matched by name.</p>
<p><strong>reproducible research</strong>: The practice of describing
and documenting research results in such a way that another researcher
or person can re-run the analysis code on the same data to obtain the
same result.</p>
<p><strong>tibble</strong>: A modern replacement for R’s data frame,
which stores tabular data in columns and rows, defined and used in the
tidyverse. Almost always when you are working with a data frame, you are
actually working with a tibble.</p>
<p><strong>tidy data</strong>: Tabular data that satisfies three
conditions that facilitate initial cleaning, and later exploration and
analysis—(1) each variable forms a column, (2) each observation forms a
row, and (3) each type of observation unit forms a table.</p>
<p><strong>Tidyverse</strong>: A collection of R packages for operating
on tabular data in consistent ways.</p>
<p><strong>vector</strong>: A sequence of values that have all the same
type. Vectors are the fundamental data structure in R; a scalar is just
a vector with exactly one element.</p>
